        <h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
            {{ $appName }} is an office asset management system. Its job is to help an organization know
            what assets it owns, where those assets are, who is using them, when they were issued, and when they were returned.
            In simple terms, it is the system that keeps equipment, supplies, and office resources organized.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system combines inventory tracking, assignment records, notifications, user control, search, activity history,
            and business settings into one application. Instead of relying on paper, memory, or scattered spreadsheets,
            staff can use one place to manage the full life of each asset.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
            <strong>One-sentence explanation for your senior:</strong><br>
            This system is a digital control center for office assets, helping the organization track stock, issue items,
            monitor returns, record history, and reduce confusion or loss.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Explain It Like I Am a Kid</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine the office has many important things like laptops, printers, routers, keyboards, and other equipment.
            If nobody keeps track of them, people can forget where they are, who borrowed them, or how many are left.
        </p>
        <p>
            This system works like a very smart notebook for the whole office:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It remembers every item.</li>
            <li>It counts how many are left.</li>
            <li>It remembers who received an item.</li>
            <li>It tells the team when stock is getting low.</li>
            <li>It records every important action so nothing is a mystery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            So if someone asks, “Where is this laptop?” or “Do we still have printer supplies?” the system can answer.

        <h2>7. Detailed Functional Explanation</h2>

        <h3>7.1 Authentication and Access</h3>
        <p>
            The system uses protected login access. Users must sign in before they can reach protected modules.
            Once signed in, the interface and permissions depend on the user role. This keeps sensitive inventory
            and operational actions limited to the right staff.
        </p>

        <h3>7.2 Dashboard</h3>
        <p>
            The dashboard is the manager's quick control panel. It summarizes the total number of assets, how many are available,
            how many units are currently assigned out, how many are in maintenance, how many are low in stock, and how many assignments
            are overdue. It also shows recent assignments and recently added items to help users understand recent activity quickly.
        </p>

        <h3>7.3 Inventory and Items</h3>
        <p>
            This is the heart of the system. Each item record stores information such as the item name, category, supplier, SKU,
            asset tag, serial number, quantity, reorder level, unit cost, location, and purchase date.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system also contains smart inventory behavior:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a user tries to create a matching non-serialized stock item that already exists, the system can increase the quantity instead of creating a duplicate record.</li>
            <li>Serialized assets are treated more strictly. If a serial number is used, the quantity must be one because that item is tracked individually.</li>
            <li>Low-stock logic checks the quantity against either the item's own reorder level or the system default threshold.</li>
            <li>Deletion is intentionally restricted when an item has active assignments, stock movement history, or audit history, which protects accountability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7.4 Stock Management</h3>
        <p>
            The stock service controls quantity changes carefully. Stock-in adds quantity. Stock-out removes quantity.
            Adjustments allow corrections with a reason. Returns add stock back after items come back from users.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is important because it prevents casual edits from breaking inventory numbers. The quantity changes are handled through
            dedicated stock movement records instead of random manual typing.
        </p>

        <h3>7.5 Assignments</h3>
        <p>
            Assignments record who received an asset, which department it belongs to, how many units were assigned, and when the assignment happened.
            When an assignment is created, the system reduces available stock. When the asset is returned, the system adds stock back and marks the assignment as returned.
        </p>
        <p>
            The report logic also organizes assignment history into three useful views:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Item-level view showing available quantity and active assigned quantity.</li>
            <li>Receiver-level view showing what each person or receiver has received.</li>
            <li>History view showing a chronological record of assignments and returns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7.6 Categories, Suppliers, and Departments</h3>
        <p>
            These modules make the system structured and easier to understand. Categories describe what kind of item it is.
            Suppliers show where the item came from. Departments show which business unit or office area is involved in assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are protective rules here too. For example, categories with linked items cannot simply be deleted without dealing with those linked records first.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>7.7 Notifications</h3>
        <p>
            Notifications help the system speak back to the team. When something important happens, such as an assignment,
            return, low stock event, asset update, or maintenance action, the system creates an in-app notification.
        </p>
        <p>
            Email copies can also be sent when the Email Notifications setting is turned on. In your current setup,
            email delivery is using the log mailer, which means the email content is written to the Laravel log unless
            a real mail service like SMTP is configured.
        </p>

        <h3>7.8 Activity Logs</h3>
        <p>
            Activity logs are the memory of the system. They help answer questions like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Who changed this asset?</li>
            <li>When was it assigned?</li>
            <li>Who returned it?</li>
            <li>Who updated important records?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This supports accountability and makes it easier to investigate issues.
        </p>

        <h3>7.9 Global Search</h3>
        <p>
            Global Search allows staff to search across multiple data areas from a single search bar. This saves time because the user does not need
            to open each page one by one to find a matching item, supplier, category, department, or assignment-related record.
        </p>

        <h3>7.10 Settings and Branding</h3>
        <p>
            The Settings page lets the organization shape the system to match the office. It stores the system name, tagline,
            company information, support email, low-stock threshold, overdue assignment days, items-per-page setting,
            and feature controls.

        <ul>
            <li>Items cannot be assigned if they are not in an available state.</li>
            <li>Users cannot assign more quantity than the stock currently has.</li>

            “This system helps us control our office assets from one central place. We can register every item,
            track how much stock we have, assign assets to people or departments, and record returns. The dashboard gives management
            a quick summary, and the logs give us accountability. Notifications help us react to low stock, maintenance,
            and assignment activity. Overall, it reduces manual work, improves visibility, and helps prevent loss or confusion.”

        <p>
            {{ $appName }} is a practical business system for organizing office assets. It is designed to answer the most important operational questions:
            what do we own, how much do we have, where is it, who is using it, and what needs attention right now?
        </p>
        <p>
            For a presentation to leadership, the strongest message is this: the system gives the organization control, visibility,
            traceability, and a more disciplined workflow for handling assets.
